Heyyyy! My name is Jin.

I am currently a senior attending University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.

One fun fact about myself is that I am a super-recognizer. 
Essentially, I can't forget someone's once I see them. :D

Another fun fact is that I know how to communicate in Morse Code!
So, when the time comes for it, I can send emergency signals with
the blinking of my eyes! :D
